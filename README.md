# LifeChain

## Mission Statement
Our aim is to tackle issues within the medical industry which include: the lack of security with patient information, the lack of historical consistency with patient data, the lack of communication between clinics and caretakers, and the lack of transparency between patients and healthcare providers. We believe that LifeChain can improve the healthcare system and solve multiple medical issues, which creates more accessible healthcare for all.<br /><br />
LifeChain focuses on:<br />
- **Security**: using Blockchain algorithms to create a chain of trust and transfer data between institutions securely<br />
- **Consistency**: maintain data integrity due to immutable Blockchain technology and<br />
- **Transparency**: allow transparency between healthcare providers and patients about diagnostics and medications<br />
- **Usability**: sleek and user friendly interface to allow for a positive user experience for all stakeholders<br />

## How It Works
- Each patient has a unique file within the **ARK** Blockchain ledger which contains all information
- Patient information includes: diagnosis history, medication history, healthcare professional contacts, requisition history, medical procedure history, and immunization history
- Each certified healthcare institution has a unique **DataStax** database deployed on **Google Cloud Platform** to offload data and access patient information
- Both patients and healthcare workers can access patient information with the combination of healthcard numbers and unique secret keys to access data

## Technologies Used
- **Ark.io**: for creating a node for Blockchain technology
- **DigitalOcean**: for creating a virtual machine to run the Ark.io node
- **DataStax Astra**: for creating databases for individual institutions
- **Google Cloud Platform**: cloud for deploying DataStax Astra
- **Figma**: for prototyping design before development
